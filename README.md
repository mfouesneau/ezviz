A quick and tiny clone of Topcat using matplotlib

What is it?
-----------

[Topcat][http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/] is an interactive graphical
viewer and editor for tabular data. Its aim is to provide most of the facilities that astronomers need for analysis and manipulation of source catalogues and other tables, though it can be used for non-astronomical data as well. It understands a number of different astronomically important formats (including FITS and VOTable) and more formats can be added.

Most of the time I was always wasting time to convert my data into a file that topcat could read (sometimes using SAMP works as well). However, I figured that python could do most of the simple cases while keeping me from going outside python.

This code is a very first hack at allowing linked plots and data selection using python and matplotlib. It uses [eztables][https://github.com/mfouesneau/eztables], anoter of my codes that provides a lot of quick functions on tabular data (including input and output)
